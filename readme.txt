Code Snippets in Comments plugin extends the Comments function by show code in highlighting without modifying the saving of comments in database.

By default Code Snippets in Comments plugin using Prism JavaScript Library as the code highlighter for its fast and light property.

Code Snippets in Comments plugin also support with two famous plugins, Prismatic and Code Syntax Block, automatically set the code highlighter with these two plugin setting. 

And I suggest just using one of these code highlighter plugin.

One more function is that Code Snippets in Comments plugin add a new code input bar below comment textarea box, let visitor type their code with problem more easier.
